appartlyot much more itever seems to occur to him that the same trslati of a word willot suit every case it is oft said that we haveo satisfactory trslati of d quixote to those who are familiar with

free from errors d mistrslatis the charge agast it is that it is stiff dry— wood a word —do e c dy that there is a fodati for it but it may be pleaded for jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrce of the light flippt jocose style of his predecessors he was e of the few very few trslators that have sho y apprehsi of the smilg gravity which is the essce of quixotic humour it seemed to him a crime to brg cervtes forward smirkg d grng at his o good thgs d to this may be attributed a great measure the ascetic abstce from everythg savourg of liveless which is the

care very little whether that form is the e which cervtes origally shaped his ideas the other hd it is clear that there are my who desire to haveot merely the story he tells but the story as he tells it so far at least as differces of idiom d circumstces permit d who will give a preferce to the cscitious trslator ev though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly but after all there iso real tagism betwe the two classes there iso reas why what pleases the e shouldot please the other or why a trslator who makes it his aim to treat d quixote with the respect due to a great classic shouldot be as acceptable ev to the careless reader as the e who treats it as a famous old jest book it isot a questi of caviare to the geral or if it is the fault rests with him who makes so the method by which cervtes w the ear of the spish people ought mutatis mutdis to be equally effective with the great majority of glish readers at y rate ev if there are readers to whom it is a matter of differce fidelity to the method is as much a part of the trslator s duty as fidelity to the matter if he c please all parties so much the better but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a represtati of his author as it is his power to give them faithful to the letter so lg as fidelity is practicable faithful to the spirit so far as he c make it my purpose here isot to dogmatise the rules of trslati but to dicate those have followed or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow the prest stce e which it seems to me cnot be too rigidly followed trslatg d quixote is to avoid everythg that savours of affectati the book itself is deed e sse a protest agast it do m abhorred it more th cervtes for this reas thk y temptati to use tiquated or obsolete lguage should be resisted it is after all affectati d e for which there iso warrt or excuse spish has probably derge less chge sce the sevteth ctury th y lguage europe d by far the greater d certaly the best part of d quixote differs but little lguage from the colloquial spish of the prest day except the tales d d quixote s speeches the trslator who uses the simplest d plaest everyday lguage will almost always be the e who approachesearest to the origal seeg that the story of d quixote d all its characters d cidts haveow be for more th two cturies d a half familiar as household words glish mouths it seems to me that the old familiarames d phrases shouldot be chged without good reas of course a trslator who holds that d quixote should receive the treatmt a great classic deserves will feel himself bod by the jcti laid up the morisco chap ixot to omit or add ythg cervantes four geratis had laughed over d quixote before it occurred to ye to ask who d what mner of m was this miguel de cervtes

sufficitly rich experice d the owledge of life to be acquated with the sort of characters which have described here would notate detail the book without missg a sgle page d dertake to read it precisely as though layg p d paper before him he were first to peruse a few pages of the work d th to recall his o life d the lives of folk with whom he has come ctact d everythg which he has se with

harm rather th the good which has be de through y lack of thought or verisimilitude of which have be guilty short for ythg d for everythg the way of criticism should be thkful also it would be excellt thg if some reader the higher walks of life some pers who stds remote both by life d by educati from the circle of folk which have pictured my book but who ows the life of the circle which he himself

that you couldot dismiss it by sayg she had be dreamg my child the mother cried why did youot tell me of this before forgot said wdy lightly she was a hurry to get her breakfast oh surely she must have be dreamg but the other hd there were the leaves mrs darlg examed them very carefully they were skelet leaves but she was sure they didot come from y tree that grew gld she crawled about the floor peerg at it with a cdle for marks of a strge foot she rattled the poker up the chiey d tapped the walls she let do a tape from the wdow to the pavemt d it was a sheer drop of thirty feet without so much as a spout to climb up by certaly wdy had be dreamg but wdy hadot be dreamg as the veryextight showed theight which the extraordary advtures of these childr may be said to have beg theight we

the dream by itself would have be a trifle but while she was dreamg the wdow of theursery blew op d a boy did drop the floor he was accompied by a strge light o bigger th your fist which darted about

should have se that he was very like mrs darlg s kiss he was a lovely boy clad skelet leaves d the juices that ooze out of trees but the most trcg thg about him was that he had all his first teeth wh

most natural d comfortable posture that the positi of the japese sittg is really natural d hygiic is sho by rect measuremts tak by the surges of the japese army these measuremts prove that the small

is felt csequce partly of the lack of properourishmt after the child is too old to live wholly up its mothers milk d partly perhaps because of the poor food that the mothers ev of the higher classes live up my babies jap are afflicted with disagreeable sk troubles especially of the scalp d face troubles which usually disappear as so as the child becomes accustomed to the regular food of the adult other csequce as image of the lack of proper food at the teethg period is the early loss of the childs first teeth which usually tu black d decay some time before the secd teeth beg to show themselves with the excepti of these two troubles japese babies seem healthy hearty d happy to extraordary degree d show that most of the cditis of their lives are wholesome the cstt out of door life d the healthful dress serve to make up csiderable measure for the poor food d the japese baby though small after the mner of the race is usually plump d of firm hard flesh e strikg characteristic of the

to tell but my impressi is that babies are bo to the world with a good start the matter of mners d that the iformly gtle d courteous treatmt that they receive from those about them together with the ctual verbal teachg of the prciple of self restrat d thoughtfuess of others produce with very little difficulty the iversally attractive mners of the people e curious thg a japese household is to see the formalities that pass betwe brothers d sisters d the respect paid to age by every member of the family the grdfather d grdmother come first of all everythg o e at table must be helped before them y case after them come the father d mother d lastly the childr accordg to their ages a yoger sister must always wait for the elder d pay her due respect ev the matter of walkg to the room before her the wishes d cvice of the elder rather th of the yoger are to be csulted everythg d this less must be leaed early by childr the differce years may be slight but the elder bo has the first right all

object of much love d care d solicitude but she doesot grow up irrespsible or traed to meet the duties which womhood will surely brg to her she must lea all the duties that fall up the wife d mother of a japese household as well as obta the structi books d mathematics that is comg to be more d more aecessity for the wom of jap she must take a certa respsibility the household must see that tea is made for the guests who may be received by her parts all but the families of highest rk must serve it herself deed it is quite the custom families of the higher classes should a guest whom it is desired to receive with especial hor de at the house to serve the meal ot with the family but separately for the father d his visitor d it is the duty of the wife or daughter ofter the latter to wait them this is hor of the guest ot accot of the lack of servts for there may be yumber of them with call or ev the back part of the room ready to receive from the hds of the yog girl what she has removed she must therefore ow the proper etiquette of the table how to serve carefully deatly d above all have the skill to ply the saké bottle so that the house may keep up its reputati for hospitality should guests arrive the absce of her parts she must receive d terta them til the master or mistress of the house retus she also feels a certa care about the behavior of the yoger members of the family especially the absce of the parts these various ways she is traed for takg up herself the cares of a household wh the time comes all but the very wealthiest d most aristocratic families the daughters of the house do a large part of the simple housework a house witho fuiture o carpets o bric à brac o mirrors picture frames or glasses to be cared for o stoves or fuaces o wdows to wash

d twkled d his usually pale face was flushed d imated the fire but brightly d the soft radice of the cdesct lights the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed d passed our glasses our chairs beg his patts embraced d caressed us rather th submitted to be sat up d there was that luxurious after dner atmosphere wh thought rs gracefully free of the trammels of precisi d he put it to us this way—markg the pots with a le forefger—as we sat d lazily admired his eaesess over thisew paradox as we thought it d his fecdity you must follow me carefully shall have to ctrovert e or two ideas that are almost iversally accepted the geometry for stce they taught you at school is foded a misccepti isot that rather a large thg to expect us to beg up said filby argumtative pers with red hair doot me to ask you to accept ythg without reasable grod for it you will so admit as much as ieed from you you ow of course that a mathematical le a le of thicess il haso real existce they taught you that neither has a mathematical ple these thgs are mere abstractis that is all right said the psychologist nor havg ly lgth breadth d thicess c a cube have a real existce there object said filby of course a solid body may exist all real thgs— so most people thk but wait a momt c stteous cube exist d t follow you said filby c a cube that doesot last for y time at all have a real existce filby became psive clearly the time traveller proceeded y real body must have extsi four directis it must have lgth breadth thicess d—durati but through aatural firmity of the flesh which will expla to you a momt we cle to overlook this fact there are really four dimsis three which we call the three ples of space d a fourth time there is however a tdcy to draw real distcti betwe the former three dimsis d the latter because it happs that our csciouess moves termitttly e directi alg the latter from the begng to the d of our lives that said a very yog m makg spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp that very clear deed now it is very remarkable that this is so extsively overlooked ctued the time traveller with a slight accessi of cheerfuess really this is what is met by the fourth dimsi though some people who talk about the fourth dimsi doot ow they me it it is ly other way of lookg at time there iso differce betwe time d y of the three dimsis of space except that our csciouess moves alg it but some foolish people have got hold of the wrg side of that idea you have all heard what they have to say about this fourth dimsi haveot said the provcial mayor it is simply this that space as our mathematicis have it is spok of as havg three dimsis which e may call lgth breadth d thicess d is always defable by referce to three ples each at right gles to the others but some philosophical people have be askg why three dimsis particularly—whyot other directi at right gles to the other three —d have ev tried to cstruct a four dimsial geometry professor sim newcomb was expodg this to the new york mathematical society ly a mth or so ago you ow how a flat surface which has ly two dimsis we c represt a figure of a three dimsial solid d similarly they thk that by models of three dimsis they could represt e of four—if they could master the perspective of the thg see thk so murmured the provcial mayor d ittg his brows he lapsed to trospective state his lips movg as e who repeats mystic words yes thk see itow he said after some time brightg a quite trsitory mner well doot md tellg you have be at work up this geometry of four dimsis for some time some of my results are curious for stce here is a portrait of a m at eight years old other at fifte other at sevte other at twty three d so all these are evidtly sectis as it were three dimsial represtatis of his four dimsied beg which is a fixed d alterable thg scitific people proceeded the time traveller after the pause required for the proper assimilati of this ow very well that time is ly a kd of space here is a popular scitific diagram a weather record this le trace with my fger shows the movemt of the barometer yesterday it was so high yesterdayight it fell th this mog it rose aga d so gtly upward to here surely the mercury didot trace this le y of the dimsis of space gerally recoised but certaly it traced such a le d that le therefore we must cclude was alg the time dimsi but said the medical m starg hard at a coal the fire if time is really ly a fourth dimsi of space why is it d why has it always be regarded as somethg differt d why cnot we move time as we move about the other dimsis of space the time traveller smiled are you so sure we c move freely space right d left we c go backward d forward freely ough d m always have de so admit we move freely two dimsis but how about up d do gravitati limits us there not exactly said the medical m there are ballos but before the ballos save for spasmodic jumpg d the equalities of the surface m hado freedom of vertical movemt still they could move a little up d do said the medical m easier far easier do th up d you cnot move at all time you cnot get away from the prest momt my dear sir that is just where you are wrg that is just where the whole world has ge wrg we are always gettg away from the prest momt our mtal existces which are immaterial d haveo dimsis are passg alg the time dimsi with a iform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel do if we beg our existce fifty miles above the earth s surface but the great difficulty is this terrupted the psychologist you c move about all directis of space but you cnot move about time that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrg to say that we cnot move about time for stce if am recallg cidt very vividly go back to the stt of its occurrce become abst mded as you say jump back for a momt of course we haveo mes of stayg back for y lgth of time y more th a savage or imal has of stayg six feet above the grod but a civilised m is better off th the savage this respect he c go up agast gravitati a ballo d why should heot hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift alg the time dimsi or ev tu about d travel the other way oh this beg filby is

traveller butow you beg to see the object of my vestigatis to the geometry of four dimsis lg ago had a vague klg of a mache— to travel through time exclaimed the very yog m that shall travel differtly y directi of space d time as the driver determes filby ctted himself with laughter but have experimtal verificati said the time traveller it would be remarkably cvit for the histori the psychologist

yhow said the psychologist though it s all humbug you ow the time traveller smiled rod at us th still smilg fatly d with his hds deep his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room d we heard his slippers shufflg do the lg passage to his laboratory the psychologist looked at us wder what he s got some sleight of hd trick or other said the medical m d filby tried to tell us about a cjuror he had se at burslem but before he had fished his preface the time traveller came back d filby s ecdote collapsed the mache the thg the time traveller held his hd was a glitterg metallic framework scarcely larger th a small clock d very delicately made there was ivory it d some trspart crystalle substce dow must be explicit for this that follows—less his explati is to be accepted—is absolutely accotable thg he took e of the small octagal tables that were scattered about the room d set it frt of the fire with two legs the hearthrug this table he placed the mechism th he drew up a chair d sat do the ly other object the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell up the model there were also perhaps a doz cdles about two brass cdlesticks up the mtel d several scces so that the room was brillitly illumated sat a low arm chairearest the fire d drew this forward so as to be almost betwe the time traveller d the fireplace filby sat behd him lookg over his shoulder the medical m d the provcial mayor watched him profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very yog m stood behd the psychologist we were all the alert it appears credible to me that y kd of trick however subtly cceived d however adroitly de could have be played up us der these cditis the time traveller looked at us d th at the mechism well said the psychologist this little affair said the time traveller restg his elbows up the table d pressg his hds together above the apparatus is ly a model it is my pl for a mache to travel through time you willotice that it looks sgularly askew d that there is odd twklg appearce about this bar as though it was some way real he poted to the part with his fger also here is e little white lever d here is other the medical m got up out of his

stupor d suddly looked der the table at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully well he said with a remiscce of the psychologist th gettg up he wt to the tobacco jar the mtel d with his back to us beg to fill his pipe we stared at each other look here said the medical m are you eaest about this do you seriously believe that that mache has travelled to time certaly said the time traveller stoopg to light a spill at the fire th he tued lightg his pipe to look at the psychologist s face the psychologist to show that he wasot hged helped himself to a cigar d tried to light it cut what is more have a big macheearly fished there —he dicated the laboratory— d wh that is put together me to have a jouey my o accot you me to say that that mache has travelled to the future said filby to the future or the past—i d t for certa ow which after terval the psychologist had spirati it must have ge to the past if it has ge ywhere he said why said the time traveller because presume that it hasot moved space d if it travelled to the future it would still be here all this time sce it must have travelled through this time but said if it travelled to the past it would have be visible wh we came first to this room d last thursday wh we were here d the thursday before that d so forth serious objectis remarked the provcial mayor with air of impartiality tug towards the time traveller not a bit said the time traveller d to the psychologist you thk you c expla that it s prestati below the threshold you ow diluted prestati of course said the psychologist d reassured us that s a simple pot of psychology should have thought of it it s pla ough d helps the paradox delightfully we cnot see it or c we appreciate this mache y more th we c the spoke of a wheel spng or a bullet flyg through the

hdredth of what it would make if it wereot travellg time that s pla ough he passed his hd through the space which the mache had be you see he said laughg we sat d stared at the vact table for a mute or so th the time traveller asked us what we thought of it all it sods plausible ough tight said the medical m but wait til tomorrow wait for the comm sse of the mog would you like to see the time mache itself asked the time traveller d therewith takg the lamp his hd he led the way do the lg draughty corridor to his laboratory remember vividly the flickerg light his queer broad head silhouette

if he got it out of his o head he said some of it but the rest was out of pirate books d robber books d every gg that was high ted had it some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets tom said it was a good idea so he took a pcil d wrote it th b rogers says heres huck fn he hat goto family what you gog to do bout him well hat he got a father says tom sawyer yes hes got a father but you ctever fd him these days he used to lay drk with the hogs the tyard but he hat be se these parts for a year or more they talked it over d they was gog to rule me out

thats what they do ive se it books d so of course thats what weve got to do but how c we do it if we dt ow what it is why blame it all weve got to do it dt tell you its the books do you wt to go to

well keep them till theyre rsomed to death d a bothersome lot theyll be too eatg up everythg d always tryg to get loose how you talk b rogers how c they get loose wh theres a guard over them ready to shoot them do if they move a peg a guard well that is good so somebodys got to set up allight dever get y sleep just so as to watch them thk thats foolisess why ct a body take a club d rsom them as so as they get here because it at the books so thats why now b rogers do you wt to do thgs regular or dt you thats the idea dt you reck that the people that made the books ows whats the correct thg to do

greater wealth of humour or imagery or more dramatic power nor y other of his writgs is the attempt made to terweave life d speculati or to cnect politics with philosophy the republic is the ctre arod

to ideal kgdom of philosophy of which all other govemts are the perversis these two pots of view are really opposed d the oppositi is ly veiled by the gius of plato the republic like the phaedrus see troducti to phaedrus is imperfect whole the higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellic temple which at last fades away to the heavs whether this imperfecti of structure arises from largemt of the pl or from the imperfect reccilemt the writer s o md of the strugglg elemts of thought which areow first brought together by him or perhaps from the compositi of the work at

arise out of the discordt elemts which the philosopher has attempted to ite a sgle whole perhaps without beg himself able to recoise the csistcy which is obvious to us for there is a judgmt of after

is the growth of time d some of the greatest creatis of the hum md have be wtg ity tried by this test several of the platic dialogues accordg to our mode ideas appear to be defective but the deficicy iso proof that they were composed at differt times or by differt hds d the suppositi that the republic was writt terruptedly d by a ctuous effort is some degree cfirmed by theumerous referces from e part of the work to other the secd title ‘ cceg justice isot the e by which the republic is quoted either by aristotle or gerally tiquity d like the other secd titles of the platic dialogues may therefore be assumed to be of later date morgste d others have asked whether the defiti of justice which is the professed aim or the cstructi of the state is the prcipal argumt of the work the swer is that the two bld e d are two faces of the same truth for justice is the order of the state d the state is the visible embodimt of justice der the cditis of hum society the e is the soul d the other is

chiefly occupied with hypotheses cceg the outward world yet ctas my dicatis that the same law is supposed to rei over the state overature d over m too much however has be made of this questi both cit

argumt ‘ the represtati of hum life a state perfected by justice d goveed accordg to the idea of good there may be some use such geral descriptis but they c hardly be said to express the desi of the

with the geral purpose what kd or degree of ity is to be sought after a buildg the plastic arts poetry prose is a problem which has to be determed relatively to the subject matter to plato himself the quiry ‘ what was the tti of the writer or ‘ what was the prcipal argumt of the republic would have be hardly telligible d therefore had better be at ce dismissed cp the troducti to the phaedrus isot the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which to plato s o md are mostaturally represted the form of the state just as the jewish prophets the rei of messiah or ‘ the day of the lord or the sufferg servt or people of god or the ‘ s of righteouess with healg his wgs ly cvey to us at least their great spiritual ideals so through the greek state plato reveals to us his o thoughts about dive perfecti which is the idea of good—like the s the visible world —about hum perfecti which is justice—about educati begng youth d ctug later years—about poets d sophists d tyrts who are the false teachers d evil rulers of mkd—about ‘ the world which is the embodimt of them—about a kgdom which existsowhere up earth but is laid up heav to be the patte d rule of hum life no such spired creati is at ity with itself y more th the clouds of heav wh the s pierces through them every shade of light d dark of truth d of ficti which is the veil of truth is allowable a work of philosophical imagati it isot all the same ple it easily passes from ideas to myths d fcies from facts to figures of speech it isot prose but poetry at least a great part of it d oughtot to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of history the writer isot fashig his ideas to artistic whole they take possessi of him d are too much for him we haveoeed therefore to discuss whether a state such as plato has cceived is practicable orot or whether the outward form or the ward life came first to the md of the writer for the practicability of his ideas hasothg to do with their truth d the highest thoughts to which he attas may be truly said to bear the greatest ‘ marks of desi —justice more th the exteal frame work of the state the idea of good more th justice the great scice of dialectic or the orgisati of ideas haso real ctt but is ly a type of the method or spirit which the higher owledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time d all existce it is the fifth sixth d sevth books that plato reaches the ‘ summit of speculati d these although they fail to satisfy the requiremts of a mode thker may therefore be regarded as the most importt as they are also the most origal portis of the work it isotecessary to discuss at lgth a mor questi which has be raised by boeckh respectg the imagary date at which the cversati was held the year b c which is proposed by him will do as well as y other for a writer of ficti d especially a writer who like plato isotoriously careless of chrology cp rep symp a etc ly aims at geral probability whether all the perss mtied the republic could ever have met at y e time isot a difficulty which would have occurred to athi readg the work forty years later or to plato himself at the time of writg y more th to shakespeare respectg e of his o dramas deedot greatly trouble usow yet this may be a questi havgo swer ‘ which is still worth askg because the vestigati shows that we cnot argue historically from the dates plato it would be useless therefore to waste time vtg far fetched reccilemts of them order to avoid chrological difficulties such for example as the cjecture of c f hermn that glauc d adeimtus areot the brothers but the cles of plato cp

d ev ascribe to it a certa coless his part which lasted two whole mths d what do you thk suddly almost at the time proposed prtg it here our poem was published abroad a collecti of revolutiary verse without the owledge of step trofimovitch he was at first alarmed rushed to the goveor d wrote aoble letter self defce to petersburg he read it to me twice but didot sd it ot owg to whom to address it fact he was a state of agitati for a whole mth but am cvced that the secret recesses of his heart he was ormously flattered he almost took the copy of the collecti to bed with him d kept it hidd der

if he had ly giv theecessary explatis but he was too lofty d he proceeded with peculiar haste to assure himself that his career was rued forever by the vortex of circumstce d if the whole truth is to be told the real cause of the chge his career was the very delicate propositi which had be made before d was th rewed by varvara petroa stavrog a lady of great wealth the wife of a lieutt geral that he should dertake the educati d the whole tellectual developmt of her ly s the capacity of a superior sort of teacher d frid to sayothg of a maifict salary this proposal had be made to him the first time berl at the momt wh he was first left a widower his first wife was a frivolous girl from our provce whom he married his early d thkg youth d appartly he had had a great deal of trouble with this yog pers charmg as she was owg to the lack of mes for her support d also from other more delicate reass she died paris after three years separati from him leavg him a s of five years old the fruit of

regi step trofimovitch had decled varvara petroas proposal that occasi d had quickly married aga before the year was over a tacitu berl girl d what makes it more strge there waso particularecessity for him to do so but apart from his marriage there were it appears other reass for his declg the situati he was tempted by the resodg fame of a professor celebrated at that time d he his tu hasted to the lecturers chair for which he had be preparg himself to try his eagle wgs flight butow with sged wgs heaturally remembered the propositi which ev th had made him hesitate the sudd death of his secd wife who didot live a year with him settled the matter decisively to put it plaly it was all brought about by the passiate sympathy d priceless so to speak classic fridship of varvara petroa if e may use such expressi of fridship he flg himself to the arms of this fridship d his positi was settled for more th twty years use the expressi flg himself to the arms of but god forbid that ye should fly to idle d superfluous cclusis these embraces must be derstood ly the most loftily moral sse the most refed d delicate tie ited these two begs both so remarkable forever the post of tutor was the more readily accepted too as the property a very small e left to step trofimovitch by his first wife was close to skvoresiki the stavrogs maifict estate the outskirts of our provcial to besides the stiless of his study far from the immse burd of iversity work it was always possible to devote himself to the service of scice d to rich the literature of his cotry with erudite studies these works didot appear but the other hd it did appear possible to spd the rest of his life more th twty years a reproach caate so to speak to hisative cotry the words of a popular poet reproach caate thou didst std erect before thy fatherld o liberal idealist but the pers to whom the popular poet referred may perhaps have had the right to adopt that pose for the rest of his life if he had wished to do so though it must have be tedious our step trofimovitch was to tell the truth ly imitator compared with such people moreover he had gro weary of stdg erect d oft lay do for a while but to do him justice the caati of reproach was preserved ev the recumbt attitude the more so as that was quite sufficit for the provce you should have se him at our club wh he sat do to cards his whole figure seemed to exclaim cards me sit do to whist with you is it csistt who is respsible for it who has shattered my ergies d tued them to whist ah perish russia d he would majestically trump with a heart d to tell the truth he dearly loved a game of cards which led him especially later years to frequt d pleast skirmishes with varvara petroa particularly as he was always losg but of that later will ly observe that he was a m of tder cscice that is sometimes d so was oft depressed the course of his twty years fridship with varvara petroa he used regularly three or four times a year to sk to a state of patriotic grief as it was called amg us or rather really to attack of sple but our estimable varvara petroa preferred the former phrase of late years his grief had beg to beot ly patriotic but at times alcoholic too but varvara petroas aleress succeeded keepg him all his life from trivial clatis d heeeded somee to look after him deed for he sometimes behaved very oddly the midst of his exalted sorrow he would beg laughg like y simple peast there were momts wh he beg to take a humorous te ev about himself but there wasothg varvara petroa dreaded so much as a humorous te she was a wom of the classic type a female mæcas variably guided ly by the highest csideratis the fluce of this exalted lady over her poor frid for twty years is a fact of the first importce shalleed to speak of her more particularly which iow proceed to do there are strge fridships the two frids are always ready to fly at e other d go like that all their lives d yet they cnot separate partg fact is utterly impossible the e who has beg the quarrel d separated will be the first to fall ill d ev die perhaps if the separati comes off ow for a positive fact that several times step trofimovitch has jumped up from the sofa d beat the wall with his fists after the most timate d emotial tête à tête with varvara petroa this proceedg was byo mes empty symbol deed e occasi he broke some plaster off the wall it may be asked how come to ow such delicate details what if were myself a wiess of it what if step trofimovitch himself has more th e occasi sobbed my shoulder while he described to me lurid colours all his most secret feelgs d what was there he didot say at such times but what almost always happed after these tearful outbreaks was thatext day he was ready to crucify himself for his gratitude he would sd for me a hurry or r over to see me simply to assure me that varvara petroa was gel of hour d delicacy while he was very much the opposite he didot ly r to cfide me but more th e occasi described it all to her the most eloqut letter d wrote a full sied cfessi thato lger ago th the day before he had told outsider that she kept him out of vity that she was vious of his talts d eruditi that she hated him d was ly afraid to express her hatred oply dreadg that he would leave her d so damage her literary reputati that this drove him to self ctempt d he was resolved to die a violt death d that he was waitg for the fal word from her which would decide everythg d so d so the same style you c fcy after this what hysterical pitch theervous outbreaks of this most noct of all fifty year old fts sometimes reached ce read e of these letters after some quarrel betwe them arisg from a trivial matter but growg vomous as it wt was horrified d besought himot to sd it must more hourable duty shall

passiately fd of writg he wrote to her though he lived the same house d durg hysterical terludes he would write two letters a day ow for a fact that she always read these letters with the greatest attti ev wh she received two a day d after readg them she put them away a special drawer sorted d notated moreover she pdered them her heart but she kept her frid all day without swer met him as though there wereothg the matter exactly as thoughothg special had happed the day before by degrees she broke him so completely that at last he didot himself dare to allude to what had happed the day before d ly glced to her eyes at times but sheever forgot ythg while he sometimes forgot too quickly d couraged by her composure he wouldot frequtly if frids came laugh d make jokes over the champae the very same day with what malicy she must have looked at him at such momts while heoticedothg perhaps a weeks time a mths time or ev six mths later chcg to recall some phrase such a letter d th the whole letter with all its attdt circumstces he would suddly grow hot with shame d be so upset that he fell ill with e of his attacks of summer cholera these attacks of a sort of summer cholera were some cases the regular csequce of hiservous agitatis d were terestg peculiarity of his physical cstituti no doubt varvara petroa did very oft hate him but there was e thg he hadot disceed up to the d that was that he had become for her a s her creati ev e may say her vti he had become flesh of her flesh d she kept d supported himot simply from vy of his talts d how woded she must have be by such suppositis exhaustible love for him lay ccealed her heart the midst of ctual hatred jealousy d ctempt she wouldot let a speck of dust fall up him coddled him up for twty two years wouldot have slept forights together if there were the fatest breath agast his reputati as a poet a leaed m d a public character she had vted him d had be the first to believe her o vti he was after a fashi her day dream but retu she exacted a great deal from him sometimes ev slavisess it was credible how lg she harboured restmt have two ecdotes to tell about that e occasi just at the time wh the first rumours of the emcipati of the serfs were the air wh all russia was exultg d makg ready for a complete regerati varvara petroa was visited by a bar from petersburg a m of the highest cnectis d very closely associated with theew reform varvara petroa prized such visits highly as her cnectis higher circles had gro weaker d weaker sce the death of her husbd d had at last ceased altogether the bar spt hour drkg tea with her there waso e else prest but step trofimovitch whom varvara petroa vited d exhibited the bar had heard somethg about him before or affected to have de so but paid little attti to him at tea step trofimovitch of course was capable of makg a social blder d his mners were most elegt though believe he was byo mes of exalted orig yet it happed that he had from earliest childhood be brought up a moscow household of high rk d csequtly was well bred he spoke frch like a parisi thus the bar was to have se from the first glce the sort of people with whom varvara petroa surroded herself ev provcial seclusi but thgs didot fall out like this wh the bar positively asserted the absolute truth of the rumours of the great reform which were th ly just begng to be heard step trofimovitch couldot cta himself d suddly shouted hurrah d ev made some gesticulati dicative of delight his ejaculati wasot over loud d quite polite his delight was ev perhaps premeditated d his gesture purposely studied before the lookg glass half hour before tea but somethg must have be amiss with it for the bar permitted himself a fat smile though he at ce with extraordary courtesy put a phrase cceg the iversal d befittg emoti of all russi hearts view of the great evt shortly afterwards he took his leave d at partg didot forget to hold out two fgers to step trofimovitch retug to the drawg room varvara petroa was at first silt for two or three mutes d seemed to be lookg for somethg the table th she tued to step trofimovitch d with pale face d flashg eyes she hissed a whisper shallever forgive you for that next day she met her frid as thoughothg had happed sheever referred to the cidt but thirte years afterwards at a tragic momt she recalled it d reproached him with it d she tued pale just as she had de thirte years before ly twice the course of her life did she say to him shallever forgive you for that the cidt with the bar was the secd time but the first cidt was so characteristic d had so much fluce the fate of step trofimovitch that vture to refer to that too it was sprg time may just after theews had reached skvoresiki of the death of lieutt geral stavrog a frivolous old gtlem who died of a stomach ailmt the way to the crimea where he was hastg to jo the army active service varvara petroa was left a widow d put deep moug she couldot it is true deplore his death very deeply sce for the last four years she had be completely separated from him owg to compatibility of temper d was givg him allowce the lieutt geral himself hadothg but e hdred d fifty serfs d his pay besides his positi d his cnectis all the mey d skvoresiki belged to varvara petroa the ly daughter of a very rich ctractor yet she was shocked by the suddness of theews d retired to complete solitude step trofimovitch of course was always at her side may was its full beauty the evgs were exquisite the wild cherry was flower the two frids walked every evg the gard d used to sit tillightfall the arbour d pour out their thoughts d feelgs to e other they had poetic momts der the fluce of the chge her positi varvara petroa talked more th usual she as it were clg to the heart of her frid d this ctued for several evgs a strge idea suddly came over step trofimovitch wasot the csolable widow reckg up him d expectg from him wh her moug was over the offer of his hd a cical idea but the very loftess of a msature sometimes creases a dispositi to cical ideas if ly from the my sideess of his culture he beg to look more deeply to it d thought it seemed like it he pdered her forte is immse of course but varvara petroa certaly couldot be called a beauty she was a tall yellow by wom with extremely lg face suggestive of a horse step trofimovitch hesitated more d more he was tortured by doubts he positively shed tears of decisi ce or twice he weptot frequtly the evgs that is to say the arbour his cotce voltarily beg to express somethg capricious d irical somethg coquettish d at the same time cdescdg this is apt to happ as it were by accidt d the more gtlemly the m the moreoticeable it is gooess ly ows what e is to thk about it but its most likely thatothg had beg workg her heart that could have fully justified step trofimovitchs suspicis moreover she wouldot have chged herame stavrog for hisame famous as it was perhaps there wasothg it but the play of femity her side the mifestati of cscious feme yeag soatural some extremely feme types however wt swer for it the depths of the female heart haveot be explored to this day but must ctue it is to be supposed that she so wardly guessed the siificce of her frids strge expressi she was quick d observt d he was sometimes extremely guileless but the evgs wt as before d their cversatis were just as poetic d terestg d behold e occasi atightfall after the most lively d poetical cversati they parted affectiately warmly pressg each others hds at the steps of the lodge where step trofimovitch slept every summer he used to move to this little lodge which stood adjog the huge seiorial house of skvoresiki almost the gard he had ly just ge d restless hesitati tak a cigar dot havg yet lighted it was stdg weary d motiless before the op wdow gazg at the light feathery white clouds glidg arod the bright mo wh suddly a fat rustle made him start d tu rod varvara petroa whom he had left ly four mutes earlier was stdg before him aga her yellow face was almost blue her lips were pressed tightly together d twitchg at the coers for t full secds she looked him the eyes silce with a firm reltless gaze d suddly whispered rapidly shallever forgive you for this wh t years later step trofimovitch after closg the doors told me this melcholy tale a whisper he vowed that he had be so petrified the spot that he hadot se or heard how varvara petroa had disappeared as sheever ce afterwards alluded to the cidt d everythg wt as thoughothg had happed he was all his life cled to the idea that it was all hallucati a symptom of iless the more so as he was actually tak ill that veryight d was disposed for a foright which by the way cut short the terviews the arbour but spite of his vague theory of hallucati he seemed every day all his life to be expectg the ctuati d so to say the douemt of this affair he couldot believe that that was the d of it d if so he must have looked strgely sometimes at his frid she had herself desied the costume for him which he wore for the rest of his life it was elegt d characteristic a lg black frock coat butted almost to the top but stylishly cut a soft hat summer a straw hat with a wide brim a white batiste cravat with a full bow d hgg ds a ce with a silver ob his hair flowed to his shoulders it was dark bro d ly lately had beg to get a little grey he was cle shav he was said to have be very hdsome his youth d to my md he was still exceptially impressive figure ev old age besides who c talk of old age at fifty three from his special pose as a patriot however he didot try to appear yoger but seemed rather to pride himself the solidity of his age d dressed as described tall d th with flowg hair he looked almost like a patriarch or ev more like the portrait of the poet kukoik graved the editi of his works published or thereabouts this resemblce was especially strikg wh he sat the gard summertime a seat der a bush of flowerg lilac with both hds propped his ce d op book beside him musg poetically over the settg s regard to books may remark that he came later years rather to avoid readg but that was ly quite towards the d the papers d magazes ordered great profusi by varvara petroa he was ctually readg heever lost terest the successes of russi literature either though he always mataed a diified attitude with regard to them he was at e time grossed the study of our home d forei politics but he so gave up the dertakg with a gesture of despair it sometimes happed that he would take de tocqueville with him to the gard while he had a paul de kock his pocket but these are trivial matters must observe parthesis about the portrait of kukoik the gravg had first come to the hds of varvara petroa wh she was a girl a high class boardg school moscow she fell love with the portrait at ce after the habit of all girls at school who fall love with ythg they come across as well as with their teachers especially the drawg d writg masters what is terestg this though isot the characteristics of girls but the fact that ev at fifty varvara petroa kept the gravg amg her most timate d treasured possessis so that perhaps it was ly this accot that she had desied for step trofimovitc']"
